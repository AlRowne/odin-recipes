# This is going to be a very basic homepage.
Until now, I've learned how to use **git**: 
- cloning repos
- adding files
- writing commit
- and pushing to remote.

I've also learned some things about **html boilerplates**:
- the basic structure
- how to add a title
- how to add links
- how to add images, including alt text and defining the size of the picture

Also a *little* bit of Markdown syntax, although I have to look at a cheatsheet for now.
