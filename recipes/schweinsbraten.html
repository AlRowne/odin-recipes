<p>The meat was cured with spices the day before roasting.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Garlic</li>
    <li>Caraway</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    <li>Probably others</li>
</ul>
<p>The next day, the meat was filled with dumpling mixture.  
    Dumplings were formed with leftover mixture and then steamed.</p>
<p>The meat was roasted in the oven at 200 degrees Celsius until it reached a core temperature of 70 degrees.</p>
<p>You can see the result in the picture above. It is advised, not to stuff the meat too thickly, otherwise it may become dry.
    Even tough our roast was stuffed quite thickly, we were lucky and the result turned out well - probably because of the type of meat we'd chosen.
